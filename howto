Install eww or eww-git for the toolbar
There is no polybar here.

sudo pacman -S eww

make a symbolic link to the eww folder in your theme

go to your .config

no eww folder present there (rename it if there is one) then open terminal in ~/.config
and type

ls -s eww ~/.config/leftwm/current/eww

then eww will take the config of your current theme

We keep using theme.toml until developer of wal creates a .ron file
